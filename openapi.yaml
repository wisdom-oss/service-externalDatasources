  title: External Datasource Service
  version: "0.1-alpha"
  description: |
    This microservice acts as central management for the used external data
    sources in the other microservices. It allows the creation of entries to
    document where the data displayed in the frontend comes from.
    
    Furthermore, this service also contains a proxy component which allows
    accessing external data sources which provide their data via HTTP APIs.
    Other methods are currently not supported, but might be implemented in
    the future.

      description: |
        Since this endpoint is used to proxy a request to a external service
        the http status codes are also returned from the external response.
        Therefore, this documentation only lists those which may be sent back
        directly by the service.
        
        When supplying transformations in the request body the service will
        only execute those in the request body.
